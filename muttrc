# Source account hooks with authorization data 
# we put some hooks with our credentials in here for each account.  They need to look like this:
# account-hook imaps://USER@SERVER 'set imap_user=USER imap_pass=PASSWORD smtp_pass=PASSWORD'
# See http://pthree.org/2012/01/07/encrypted-mutt-imap-smtp-passwords/ for more on encrypting this.
